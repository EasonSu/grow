Description:
  - Check on the changed lines of code only - Diff mode

    Set up PHPCS with WordPress coding standards to run the PHPCS check in the
    local environment and GitHub Actions.

    If it's introducing PHPCS into a legacy repository for the first time,
    choosing to perform the check on the changed lines of code would be helpful
    to fix the existing codebase gradually.

  - PHPCS config file

    Create a phpcs.xml.dist or phpcs.xml file for configuring PHPCS.
    It will also ask about the text domain and exclusion patterns.

  - Local scripts

    Add `lint:php` script into package.json.

    With diff mode, it will also add `lint:php:diff` script into package.json and
    create a bash script under ./bin to run the check locally.

  - Github Actions check

    Set up a workflow file under .github/workflows to check PHPCS in Github Actions.
    It will also ask preferred PHP version of the check job in Github Actions.

    With non-diff mode, the branches are used to specify the triggering branches of
    a push event in GitHub Actions.

  - Required composer packages

    Running PHPCS locally requires some composer packages. Please select packages
    that are not yet installed or need to be updated.
