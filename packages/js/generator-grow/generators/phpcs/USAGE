Description:
  Set up PHPCS with WordPress coding standards to run the PHPCS check in the
  local environment and GitHub Actions.

  If it's introducing PHPCS into a legacy repository for the first time,
  choosing to perform the check on the changed lines of code would be helpful
  to fix the existing codebase gradually.
