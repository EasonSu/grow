## Development

### Directory structure of source code

```
/packages/js/github-actions/  # The root of this package
â”œâ”€â”€ actions/                  # All actions to be exposed in the release build
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ prepare-node/         # Composite action
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ action.yml
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md         # How to use this action
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ update-version-tags/  # JavaScript action
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ src/              # Script sources
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ parse-version.js
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ repo-tool.js
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ action.yml
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/                    # Sources of the shared files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ do-something.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json              # The required dependent packages of the scripts, tests, build, and etc
â””â”€â”€ README.md                 # The overall info about this Github actions package
```

- The `src` directories will be skipped in the release build.
- When adding a new script that needs to be built, add its build script to package.json and make sure it will be called in `npm run build`.

### Directory structure of release build

```
/                               # Entry points for the caller repositories
â”œâ”€â”€ prepare-node/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ action.yml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ update-version-tags/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ update-version-tags.js  # Built file
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ action.yml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ README.md                   # Document prompts viewers to find the correct source code
```

The release build will be committed to a standalone point in the git tree via the release workflow, to make these custom GitHub actions have better paths and can be fetched faster.

## Release

### Official release

1. Create the specific branch `release/actions` onto the target revision on `trunk` branch.
1. The ["GitHub Actions - Prepare New Release" workflow](https://github.com/woocommerce/grow/actions/workflows/github-actions-prepare-release.yml) will continue to prepend changelog to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), update versions to [package.json](package.json) and [package-lock.json](package-lock.json), and then commit the changes to `release/actions` branch.
1. Create a release PR from `release/actions` branch with `trunk` as the base branch.
1. Check if the new changelog content and updated version are correct.
   - For a patch version like fixing bugs, increases the Z number. For example, `actions-v1.4.8`.
   - For a minor version like adding new features, increases the Y number and reset the Z to 0. For example, `actions-v1.5.0`.
   - For a major version like having incompatible changes, increases the X number and reset the Y and Z to 0. For example, `actions-v2.0.0`.
1. Create a new release with a new version tag.
1. Check if the ["GitHub Actions - Release" workflow](https://github.com/woocommerce/grow/actions/workflows/github-actions-release.yml) is run successfully.
1. After publishing the new release, the "GitHub Actions - Release" workflow of the GitHub Actions in this repo will continue the creating and committing the release build. And then update the references of the corresponding major and minor version tags onto the new release. For example:
   - When the new release version is `actions-v1.4.8`, it should update the references of `actions-v1` and `actions-v1.4` onto `actions-v1.4.8`.
   - When the new release version is `actions-v1.5.0`, it should update the reference of `actions-v1` and create `actions-v1.5` tag onto `actions-v1.5.0`.
   - When the new release version is `actions-v2.0.0`, it should create `actions-v2` and `actions-v2.0` tags onto `actions-v2.0.0`.
1. Merge the release PR.

### Testing release

1. Create a new release with a **prerelease version tag**. For example `actions-vX.Y.Z-pre`.
1. Check if the ["GitHub Actions - Release" workflow](https://github.com/woocommerce/grow/actions/workflows/github-actions-release.yml) is run successfully.
1. Delete the testing releases and tags once they are no longer in use.
