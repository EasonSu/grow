# Grow Team Storybook

Storybook dependencies and basic scripts


## Prerequisites

- Create StoryBook config files as if you installed it in your own repository.
- Configure GH Pages as if you would do it in your own repository.

Example of working implementation can be found in [GLA plugin storybook folder](https://github.com/woocommerce/google-listings-and-ads/tree/develop/storybook) and [GLA plugin package.json](https://github.com/woocommerce/google-listings-and-ads/blob/develop/package.json)

## Usage

- `storybook` Generates a storybook local dev server watching for changes
- `storybook build` Compiles and generates `dist` folder with the storybook
- `storybook deploy` Calls storybook `build` and deploys `dist` folder to GH pages.
