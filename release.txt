# This file is a placeholder for the releases to be run in bulk.
# It is designed to copy/paste from the release spreadsheet with
# minimal changes needed.
#
# All lines starting with the # symbol will be ignored.
#
# Each line is an individual extension to release, and data on the
# line should be separated by tab characters. The only required data
# is the extension slug and the version to release. Optionally, the
# branch to use for the release can be included if it is different
# than the default branch (see extensions.json).
#
# This file is added to Git, but changes to the file should be ignored.
#
# Example line:
# woocommerce-ventures-product	1.1.1	release/1.1.1
